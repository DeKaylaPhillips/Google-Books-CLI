**Error Handling**

Line 26 - Search Query Errors 
- [ ] Program accounts for no input at all
- [ ] Need to account for null authors/publishers

Line 64 - Book Selection Errors *Fixed*
- [ ] Selection should only be successful with input numbers 1-5.
- [ ] Accounts for no book selection input.
- [ ] Program falsely adds book to reading list when using 0 as a selection number. More than likely an indexing issue. [2022-12-20](syntax error w/ operators corrected)
- [ ] Program needs to appropriately handle numbers above 5. Input of 6 returns IndexError. [2022-12-20] (syntax error w/ opeerators corrected)

Line 72 - Menu Selection Errors *Fixed*
- Menu should return to search interface or reading list based on the input value.
- [ ] Program returns to search when no input value is found.
- [ ] Program does not return to search menu when 1 is selected. [2022-12-20] (menu_selection var casted to an integer for proper comparison of input value)
- [ ] Program does not print reading list when 2 is selected. [2022-12-20] (menu_selection var casted to an integer for proper comparison of input value)

Reading List Errors *Fixed*
- Reading list should reflect updated status with every book a user chooses to add to the list 
- [ ] Reading list not updating with multiple selections. [2022-12-20] (created global reading_list variable instead of local reading_list variable so list does not recreate every time the "search_books()" function is called)

Line 30 - Publisher Errors from API *Fixed*
- Some books do not have publishers. 
- [ ] Need to account for this potential error prior to displaying all data. [2022-12-20] (used .get() method to set new default value for publishers not present in the data)


## REFACTORED SUBMISSION NOTES

What features will this project implement?

The user will be able to:
    1. display 5 books matching a query
    2. display book details 
      - author 
      - title 
      - publishing company
    3. select a book from the 5 displayed books to save to personal Reading List
    4. view a Reading List with all books the user has selected from their query search results

How would I implement object-oriented programming into this project? 

Identify the scope of the project: 
    - this is a command-line-interface application that uses the Google Books API to send queries and receive results in the form of book information

Identify properties of a Google Books Command Line Interface:

    - book matches for query
      - returns the book data for each of the 5 books which would be the author, title, and publishing company
    
    - Google Books API
      - json response to grab book info based on the search query 
      - returns the top 5 books from the search results
  
    - readling list
      - book author(s) and title
      - list of selected books []
  
    - command line interface
      - handles user input and output for:
        - search query
        - adding to a reading list
        - viewing a reading list
